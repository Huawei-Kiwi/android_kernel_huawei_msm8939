* Memory Share Driver (MEMSHARE)

The Memshare driver implements a Kernel QMI service on the
LA-APSS, which is responsible for providing contiguous physical
memory to MPSS for use cases when the modem requires additional
memory (e.g. GPS).

Required properties for Memshare

-Root Node-

- compatible:	Must be "qcom,memshare"
- qcom,num-clients: Indicates the number of child nodes

All child nodes have different compatible stings.

Required properties for child nodes:

- compatible:	Must be "memshare,peripheral"

- qcom,peripheral-size: Indicates the size (in bytes) required for that child.

- label: Indicates the peripheral information for the node. Should be one of
  the following:
  - modem	/* Represent Modem Peripheral */
  - adsp	/* Represent ADSP Peripheral */
  - wcnss	/* Represent WCNSS Peripheral */

Example:

qcom,memshare {
	compatible = "qcom,memshare";

	qcom,client_1 {
		compatible = "memshare,peripheral";
		qcom,peripheral-size = <2097152>;
		label = "modem";
	};
};
